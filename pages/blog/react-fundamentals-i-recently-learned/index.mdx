Recently I've gone through
[Kent C. Dodds' "The Beginner's Guide to React"](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react)
and even though I've been working with React for a while, I learned a couple of
things, so I wanted to write about them. The course is more in depth though, so
I recommend you go through it yourself and see if you can also pick up some new
knowledge about the React basics along the way!

## PropTypes are actually a simple function

Ever since I started using React I have been using the `prop-types` package from
the React team to verify my props. I actually never thought about how that works
internally, turns out these are just simple functions.

You could easily write your own PropType-Checker with this signature:

```jsx
function PropChecker(props, propName, componentName) {
  // ...
}

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  myProp: PropChecker,
}
```

You will probably never need to use this in day-to-day application development,
but maybe you can take advantage of this when writing a React library and you
want to provide a great developer experience to your users by validating the
props to prevent strange behavior.

## Consecutive `ReactDOM.render` calls will rerender your tree

I always thought that `ReactDOM.render` will unmount everything below the target
element and mount a completely new React tree. But actually, if you have
rendered to that node before, it will just rerender the tree, just like if you
trigger a rerender through Reacts regular mechanisms.

So I still would not say that calling `ReactDOM.render` multiple times is
neccesarily good, but it is definitely not as bad as I thought!

## Use Native Forms

I have gotten this bad habid of omitting the `<form>` tag and using the
`onSubmit` method for my forms. Most of the times I would just throw together a
couple of `<input />` elements and a `<button type="button">` to submit the form
via `onClick`. This is not actually advices for accessibility reasons and also
disables some other goodies that the browser gives to you for free, like
submitting a form by pressing enter in one of the form fields.

This way you also do not have to track form values inside your state if you only
need them on submit, which increases performance.

Of course there is always `[react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)` to
help you with all these things aswell.

## Colocate State

At my dayjob we use a lot of Redux and therefore I have seen many cases where
this should be taken more seriously.

Sometimes we need state to reach across multiple children so we lift it up or
even extract it into context or another state management solution like Redux.
But we rarely pay attention to where we could colocate state to simplify our
code.

So maybe you should also start looking for places in your source code where you
can push state further to the places where it is needed.

## Use a Status State for HTTP Requests

So I've done a lot of ways to to HTTP requests. I've had error state and checked
that for null like this:

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState()
  const [error, setError] = useState()

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const username = event.target.elements.username.value

    fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos`)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((responseData) => setData(responseData))
      .catch((e) => setError(e))
  }

  let content

  if (error) {
    content = <p>Oops, something has gone wrong...</p>
  }

  if (data) {
    content = <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
  }

  return (
    <>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input placeholder="GitHub username" name="username" />
        <button type="submit">Load Repositories</button>
      </form>
      <div>{content ?? "Go ahead and fetch some repositories!"}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

But now if a query fails and we set the `error` state, it will stay in this
state forever, because we forgot to clear it out. Also the code is quite
dependent on the order of the `if`-statements and their return statements. If we
would place the `if(data)` statement above the error one, we would have the same
problem, but that errors for subsequent requests would be ignored.

The most error resilient way to code this is using a status state field (could
you even call this a state machine)?:

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState()
  const [status, setStatus] = useState("idle")

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const username = event.target.elements.username.value

    setStatus("pending")
    fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos`)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((responseData) => {
        setStatus("resolved")
        setData(responseData)
      })
      .catch((e) => {
        // logErrorToService(e);
        setStatus("rejected")
      })
  }

  let content

  if (status === "idle") {
    content = <p>Go ahead and fetch some user repos!</p>
  }

  if (status === "pending") {
    content = <p>Loading...</p>
  }

  if (status === "rejected") {
    content = <p>Oops, something has gone wrong...</p>
  }

  if (status === "resolved") {
    content = <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
  }

  return (
    <>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input placeholder="GitHub username" name="username" />
        <button type="submit">Load Repositories</button>
      </form>
      <div>{content}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

This way you can easily see which component will get rendered in which state,
which is what React is all about.

You also do not rely on the order of if statements anymore and easily
distinguish idle and loading states.

So these are some of the things I picked up in "The Beginner's Guide to React".
I have been working with React for over a year now, but there is always
something new you can learn!

Check out "The Beginner's Guide to React" for yourself and tell me about what
you learned on Twitter!
