Recently I've gone through
[Kent C. Dodds' "The Beginner's Guide to React"](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react)
and even though I've been working with React for a while, I learned a couple of
new things.

## Proptypes Are Simple Functions

Since I started using React, I've used the `prop-types` package to verify props.
I never actually thought about how this worked, but it turns out that a
prop-type is a simple function that returns an `Error` if the input is invalid.

So you could write your own "prop-type-checker":

```jsx
function PropChecker(props, propName, componentName) {
  // ...
}

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  myProp: PropChecker,
}
```

You'll probably never need this in day-to-day application development, but you
could use this if you're writing a React library and you want to give your users
a great developer experience by validating the props to prevent weird behavior.

## Successive `ReactDOM.render` Calls Will Re-render Your Tree

I used to think that `ReactDOM.render` would unmount everything below the target
element and mount a completely new React tree. But in reality, if you previously
rendered to that node, it will just re-render the tree, just like when you
trigger a re-render through React state updates.

I'd still say that calling `ReactDOM.render` multiple times is probably not
good, but it's definitely not as bad as I thought!

## Using Native Forms Gives You Lots of Goodies

I've gotten into the bad habit of leaving out the `<form>` tag and using the
`onSubmit` method for my forms. Most of the time I just threw together a couple
of `<input />` elements and a `<button type="button">` to submit the form via
`onClick`.

Not only does this suck for accessibility reasons, but it also misses out on the
UX patterns that the browser otherwise gives you for free, like submitting a
form by pressing enter in one of its fields.

You can also leave these forms uncontrolled and just rely on the
`onSubmit`-callback of the `<form>` element, which is more performant than
updating the state on every keystroke (though the difference might not be
noticable).

## Colocate State

In my day job, we use Redux and so I've seen many cases where this should be
taken more seriously.

Sometimes we need state to span across many children so we lift it up or even
extract it into Context or another state management solution like Redux. But we
rarely pay attention to where we could colocate the state to simplify our code.

So maybe you should also start looking for places in your source code where you
can push state further to where it's needed.

## Use Status Fields More Often

I've made HTTP requests in many different ways. I've had an error state and
checked that for null, like this:

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState()
  const [error, setError] = useState()

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const username = event.target.elements.username.value

    fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos`)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((responseData) => setData(responseData))
      .catch((e) => setError(e))
  }

  let content

  if (error) {
    content = <p>Oops, something has gone wrong...</p>
  }

  if (data) {
    content = <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
  }

  return (
    <>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input placeholder="GitHub username" name="username" />
        <button type="submit">Load Repositories</button>
      </form>
      <div>{content ?? "Go ahead and fetch some repositories!"}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

But now if a query fails and we set the `error` state, it will stay in that
state forever, because we forgot to clear it. Also, the code is quite dependent
on the order of the `if`-statements and their return statements. If we placed
the `if (data)` statement above the error statement, we would have the same
problem, but the errors for subsequent requests would be ignored.

The most error-tolerant way to code this is to use a status state field:

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState()
  const [status, setStatus] = useState("idle")

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const username = event.target.elements.username.value

    setStatus("pending")
    fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos`)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((responseData) => {
        setStatus("resolved")
        setData(responseData)
      })
      .catch((e) => {
        // logErrorToService(e);
        setStatus("rejected")
      })
  }

  let content

  if (status === "idle") {
    content = <p>Go ahead and fetch some user repos!</p>
  }

  if (status === "pending") {
    content = <p>Loading...</p>
  }

  if (status === "rejected") {
    content = <p>Oops, something has gone wrong...</p>
  }

  if (status === "resolved") {
    content = <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
  }

  return (
    <>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input placeholder="GitHub username" name="username" />
        <button type="submit">Load Repositories</button>
      </form>
      <div>{content}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

Your request can only ever be in one state. Your logic should resemble that.

This way you can see which component is rendered in which state, and that's what
React is all about.

Also, you no longer have to rely on the order of if statements can and easily
distinguish idle and loading states.

So those are some of the things I picked up in "The Beginner's Guide to React".
I've been working with React for over a year now, but there's always something
new to learn, maybe even some of the basic stuff!

I recommend you check out "The Beginner's Guide to React" for yourself and try
not to skip too much, the best learnings are the patterns we see along the way.

Cheers!
