While previously you had to use a
[special loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/worker-loader) to use Web
Workers with Webpack, v5 introduced
[native support for Web Workers](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/#native-worker-support)
and made it easy to leverage them in your application.

If you don't know about Web Workers already: They are a way to use
multi-threading in web-development and let you run code off the main thread. You
can communicate with them via `postMessage`.

To create a Web Worker you use the `new Worker` constructor and give it a URL to
the workers source code:

```js
const worker = new Worker("/worker.js")
```

If you want Webpack to recognize the worker file and run it through its build
pipeline use the `new URL` constructor:

```js
const worker = new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url))
```

Webpack will create a new entry point for your worker and process all its files
with your specified loaders and plugins. That means you can use
`import`-statements in your worker like you're used to. Webpack will do its
usual magic to compile these away, so you don't need
[native support for `import` in workers](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_worker_worker_ecmascript_modules),
which at the time of writing this is still pretty sparse.

You can also import libraries from npm into your worker and reuse code inside
and outside the worker, if it is compatible with the worker environment.

---

If you want to have an easier time working with Web Workers, I recommend using
the [`comlink`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/comlink) library. It makes talking
to your worker as easy as calling a method on it or accessing a property with
async/await. No `postMessage` needed!

And if you want to learn more about Web Workers in general, check out
[this talk](https://youtu.be/7Rrv9qFMWNM) from Surma. It gives a great
introduction to workers and when you should use them.

Cheers!
